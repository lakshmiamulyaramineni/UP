In a C Program, there is only one comment format. All comments must start with an open
comment token, /*, and end with a close comment token, */. C++ programs use the C tokens for
comments that span several lines. Single-line comments start with two slashes (//). In either case,
the start token can be anywhere on the line.
Write a script to change every single-line comment in a C++ source file that uses C
program start and end comment tokens to a single-line comment starting with a C++ single-line
token. The comment itself is to be unchanged.
